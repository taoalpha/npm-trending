I will keep NPM trending as a serverless site, so some features require visitors' data and data persistent won't be added.


#### Pending
- consider dependencies too when calculate trends, or as a separate column
- add `packages depend on this package` section for those packages listed in daily report: for those popular ones, may just list top 100 ?
- num of packages created distributed by months
- still a miss between `total` and statDb.length, why ?
- responsive

#### Done
- [x] add a mini graph to every package to show history trends, similar to what NPM has now (for a week)
- [x] use data we collected (put history downloads, ~5 days to stat json)
- [x] add `dep` to info-x.json when fetch for info
- [x] generate some diff reports on: new packages added, packages updated last day, etc
- [x] duplicated packages should be collapsed by default(or maybe link to where it is always)
- [x] clean up the main.ts code
- [x] new packages fetched (link on the `total: xxxx` part) (dup with 4)
- [x] move css / js to ts + scss and add pre-processor
- [x] add a version chart :)
