I will keep NPM trending as a serverless site, so some features require visitors' data and data persistent won't be added.

1. consider dependencies too when calculate trends, or as a separate column
2. [x] add a mini graph to every package to show history trends, similar to what NPM has now (for a week)
2.1 [x] use data we collected (put history downloads, ~5 days to stat json)
3. add `packages depend on this package` section for those packages listed in daily report: for those popular ones, may just list top 100 ?
4. generate some diff reports on: new packages added, packages updated last day, etc
5. [x] duplicated packages should be collapsed by default(or maybe link to where it is always)
6. clean up the main.js code
7. new packages fetched (link on the `total: xxxx` part)
